# Currency Converter App with Custom Hook and Mode Switch using Context API

## Overview

This Currency Converter application allows users to convert between different currencies using real-time exchange rates obtained from an API. The app is built using React and utilizes a custom hook for handling currency conversion logic. Additionally, it includes a mode switch feature using the Context API for toggling between light and dark modes.
